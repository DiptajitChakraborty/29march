    "Ans: Lasso Regression, also known as L1 regularization, is a linear regression technique that incorporates regularization to improve model performance and feature selection.In Lasso Regression, the model's objective function is modified by adding a penalty term proportional to the absolute values of the model's coefficients. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between Lasso Regression and other regression techniques lies in the penalty term. In Ridge regression, the penalty term is proportional to the squared values of the coefficients, while Lasso uses the absolute values. This fundamental distinction leads to different properties and behaviors.Lasso Regression differs from other regression techniques by incorporating L1 regularization, which promotes sparsity and feature selection. It is a useful tool for handling high-dimensional data and identifying relevant predictors in a model."

    "Ans: \n",
    "Lasso Regression has a tuning parameter that can be adjusted to control the strength of regularization and impact the model's performance. The main tuning parameter in Lasso Regression is known as \"alpha\" or \"lambda\" (λ).\n",
    "\n",
    "The tuning parameter, alpha (α), determines the trade-off between fitting the training data well and keeping the model's coefficients small. It controls the amount of shrinkage applied to the coefficients and influences the sparsity of the model. A higher value of alpha results in stronger regularization and more coefficients being driven towards zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effects of tuning parameters are :\n",
    "1. As the value of alpha increases, Lasso Regression becomes more likely to drive coefficients to exactly zero. This leads to more aggressive feature selection, where less relevant features are excluded from the model. Conversely, when alpha is close to zero, Lasso behaves similarly to ordinary least squares regression and may retain more features.\n",
    "2. Increasing the value of alpha leads to a simpler model with fewer non-zero coefficients. This can help reduce overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance. By controlling the sparsity of the model, alpha helps strike a balance between model complexity and predictive accuracy.\n",
    "3.  Adjusting alpha in Lasso Regression allows for controlling the bias-variance tradeoff. Higher values of alpha increase the amount of regularization, which can reduce variance but introduce some bias into the model. Conversely, lower values of alpha decrease the regularization, resulting in a higher variance but potentially lower bias.\n",
    "4. The value of alpha can affect the stability of the model. When alpha is small, slight changes in the data can lead to substantial changes in the coefficients. On the other hand, higher values of alpha can improve the stability of the model by reducing the sensitivity to small changes in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So basically adjusting the tuning parameter alpha in Lasso Regression allows for controlling the sparsity of the model, influencing feature selection, model complexity, bias-variance tradeoff, and model stability. The appropriate choice of alpha depends on the dataset and the desired balance between interpretability and predictive performance."

    "Ans: Lasso Regression is primarily a linear regression technique that assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable. However, it can be extended to handle non-linear regression problems through feature engineering or by using basis functions. But these approaches require careful consideration and domain knowledge when selecting appropriate non-linear transformations or basis functions. Additionally, if the non-linear regression problem is highly complex, alternative regression techniques designed specifically for non-linear relationships may be more suitable."
